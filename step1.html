<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">This will be a quick lesson that will give us 
some good practice making selections in Photopea, then having some fun with 
those selections. We are going to add an image of a regular person into the image 
of a city skyline so it looks like the city is being attacked by a giant. This will give you some wonderful 
practice making selections and adjusting an image so that it looks like it 
actually belongs in a completely different image. This is one of the most common 
tasks for graphic designers, so pay attention. If you do any image editing in 
the future, this will probably come up.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">For this lesson, we will all work through adding 
a person to another image, and then you will work independently using the tools 
and techniques you learn to create a custom image where you are the giant.</span></p>

<span style="font-size:12.0pt"><font color="#800000"><b>A word of caution:</b></font> This project assumes that you have at least some experience with Photopea, so 
  these directions will not include an overview of the layout of the software or 
  take the time to discuss the difference between tools and filters and other such 
  things. If you have never used Photopea (or Photoshop), then I recommend that 
  you stop now and have a look at a Photopea (or Photoshop) absolute beginner 
  tutorial to gain an understanding of the Photopea workspace. Then you can return 
  here and keep working. If these instructions refer to something that you are 
  unfamiliar with and do not understand how it works, it is your responsibility to 
  look further at the issue to figure it out. Take pride in your work and attempt 
  to solve your own problems - you will enjoy this process much more if you are 
  doing the work yourself.</span></p></div>

most of you were probably thinking of when I explained what this project

the most useful skill in the world. Still, it has come in handy for others in 
the past. Consider these image...</span></p>
