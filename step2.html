<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; "> &nbsp;Our first task in 
getting our guy into the city photo is to make a selection of him. There are 
several ways to create a selection in Photopea, so let's use a method that will 
work well with our current image and give us a fairly accurate beginning 
selection: the Magnetic Lasso Select Tool. The Magnetic Lasso Select Tool allows 
us to create selections by tracing the outline of an object in our image. For 
this to work, we need to start with an image where the object we want to select 
(the guy) is significantly different in color from the rest of the image. The 
Magnetic Lasso Select Tool works by recognizing the difference between light and 
dark colors in the image and uses them to define the selection area. If the 
color differences are slight, this tool will not work as well. But since our guy 
is darker than most of the background, we should get a fairly accurate 
selection.</p>
<ol>

holding the Alt key and then rolling the mouse wheel up<li>
Click at the tip of the </font><Font face="Times New Roman">
<span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>
guy's toe, and then SLOWLY drag up and around his body...<br>
	</span>

	Don't worry about getting every little piece of him as we will fix any 
	selection errors in just a second (also, don't worry about his backpack - we 
	just want him)</span></font></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">Here are a few things to 
keep in mind as you move around the outline of the guy:</span></p>
<ul>
	<li><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">Notice that the above 
	direction says to go <font color="#FF0000"><b>SLOWLY</b></font>, this is 
	important! If you drag too fast with the Magnetic Lasso Select Tool, 
	Photopea is unable to analyze the area and determine where the color 
	difference is located. This will cause the selection line to be laid down 
	inaccurately. Have some patience when making this initial selection around 
	the guy and you will have less work to do to clean up selection later in 
	this step.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">As you move around 
	his body, you can reposition what is visible by pressing and holding the 
	spacebar and clicking on the image and dragging to move to a new area. When 
	you release the spacebar, you can continue outlining the guy.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">The Magnetic Lasso 
	Select Tool drops points - little squares - at various positions around the 
	guy. These squares are there to let you know where Photopea has defined a 
	change in direction of the selection outline. If you try to go around a 
	curve or encounter a pointed area and Photopea does not drop a square, you 
	can force a square to be dropped by clicking the mouse button. This will 
	prevent Photopea from making wide shifts in the selection line, which can 
	cause areas that we want to include to be skipped.</span></li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
	<Font face="Times New Roman">
	<li>
	When you have dragged 
	around his entire body and return to the tip of his toe, click back on the 
	spot where you first clicked to complete the selection of the guy...<br>
	<span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>
    <img width=522 height=502
src="pics/22.jpg" v:shapes="Picture_x0020_88"><br>
	Note that if you have a difficult time clicking on the exact spot you 
	started that you can simply double-click the mouse button to complete the 
	selection</span></li>
</ol>
</font>
<Font face="Times New Roman,serif">
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; ">While the Magnetic Lasso 
Select Tool works great for making general selections, there will inevitably be 
areas that are either missed or included when they should not be. This is easy 
to correct.</p>
</font>
<Font face="Times New Roman">
<ol start="5">
	<li>
	<span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Click
    the Lasso Select Tool<br>
	</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>
    <img width=39 height=60
src="pics/23.jpg" v:shapes="Picture_x0020_88"></span></li>
	<li>
	<span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Zoom
    in on the guy's foot...<br>
	</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>
    <img width=550 height=358
src="pics/24.jpg" v:shapes="Picture_x0020_94"></span></li>
	<li>
	<span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Start
    at his toe and work your way up the guy's leg using the Lasso Tool
    to modify the selection</span></li>
</ol>
</font>
<Font face="Times New Roman,serif">
<p>If you are unfamiliar with the Lasso Select Tool, it has a pretty simple 
function. Click and drag to draw a line, and when you release the mouse button 
Photopea converts the line to a selection. For what we are doing, since we 
already have a selection, we need to use the Lasso Select Tool to modify the 
selection. We can either add to or take away from the current selection.</p>
<ul>
	<li>T<Font face="Times New Roman"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>o 
	add to your selection, press and hold the Shift key while you click and drag 
	a line around the area you want to add</span></font></li>
	<li>
<Font face="Times New Roman">
	<span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>To delete 
	from your selection, press and hold the Alt key while you click and drag a 
	line around the area you want to remove</span></font></li>
</ul>
<p>You should always try to make a circular-ish line when using the Lasso Select 
Tool. This does not mean that you must always draw circles, just in a circular 
fashion. You want your line to end up close to where you began. It doesn't have 
to go to the exact same spot, just in the general area. This is because when you 
release the mouse button to apply the selection change, Photopea draws a 
straight line between where you release the mouse button and the first place you 
clicked. If the two points are not relatively close to each other, you can get 
all kinds of strange results.</p>
</font>
<Font face="Times New Roman">
<ol start="8">
	<li>
	<span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Work 
	around the rest of the guy's body adding to or removing from the selection 
	as needed until you have an accurate 
	outline...<br>
	</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>
    <img width=550 height=523
src="pics/25.jpg" v:shapes="Picture_x0020_94"></span></li>
</ol>
</font>
<Font face="Times New Roman,serif">
<p>A couple of things to keep in mind as you go around the guy (you can look at 
my image above to clarify the items below):</p>
<ul>
	<li>Individual pixels do not really matter - try to create a selection that 
	is accurate, but do not waste a lot of time on one or two pixels (these will 
	likely not be visible in the final image anyway)</li>
	<li>Make sure to select only his fingers and not the parts of the car 
	between them</li>
	<li>Be sure to remove the area between his arms</li>
	<li>A small piece of the backpack is actually covering the back of his head 
	- ignore that and give him a round head</li>
	<li>Again, ignore his backpack - we just want him</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we have an accurate selection of our guy, the next step is to get 
him into our city image.</p>
