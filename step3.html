the easiest is simply using copy/paste (if you want to use a different method go 
for it!).</p>

You can rename the layer that 
your guy sits on if you want, but it's not necessary. Just make sure as you work 
through the rest of this project that the layer that your guy sits on stays 
selected. We will be creating additional layers later, but we will not be modifying the 
Background (the city) layer at all.<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; ">
