  wrap up this lesson, you will each create a unique image where you are the 
giant. You can create any kind of image you like, just as 
long as your finished product looks realistic.</span></p>

<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Follow the directions below 
to create your image:</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:

Some things to keep in mind when selecting a background image:</p>
</font>
<ul>
	<li>
The image you choose needs to be of a scale so that when you place yourself in 
the image you will look like a giant (note that there have been 28 images up to 
this point that you can use as example images, and there are more below)</font><li>
Try to find an image that is similar in tone and color to the selfie you will 
take to place yourself in the image (this will mean less work later when you 
have to match brightness and color like you did in Step 4)<Font face="Times New Roman"><li>
Think about how you will need to add shadows into the image to make it look 
realistic - some background will make this more difficult than others</li>
	<li>
Some images are easier to work with than others - choose wisely!</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>I want to give a quick word of warning here. When selecting your image, think 
carefully before going with a picture where you are going to place yourself in 
water. Consider the following image...</p>
<p align="center"> 
<span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>
<a href="pics/134.jpg" target="_blank">
<img width=700 height=403
src="pics/134.jpg" v:shapes="Picture_x0020_7" border="0"></a></span></p>
<p>Notice that while the color and lighting of the girl perfectly matches the 
background, that the lack of ripples in the water make it obvious that she is 
added in. Now look at these two images...</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:
normal" align="center">

</font>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:
normal"> 
Notice how adding ripples in the water around the girl and the giraffe's mouth 
make it much more believable that they are actually in contact with the water. 
If you want to place yourself in water then go for it, just make sure to add in 
some ripples in the water (this is easily done with the Brush Tool with a gray 
color and drawing in the lines - they don't have to be perfect, just visible).</p>

	<p>Once your image is saved, you need to take a picture of yourself to

	mind as you plan your selfie:</p>
	<ul>
<Font face="Times New Roman">
		<li>
<Font face="Times New Roman,serif">
		Determine how you want to fit into the image - there needs to be a 
reason for you to be there (remember the two guys playing tetherball)</font></li>
		<li>
		<Font face="Times New Roman,serif">
		You should interact with the surrounding in some way (remember the polar 
		bear and the guy pulling the CN Tower in Step 1)</font></li>
<li>
		<Font face="Times New Roman,serif">
		Keep in mind that it needs to LOOK like you belong there - we have 
		talked a lot about making the giant look realistic!</font></li>
</font>
<Font face="Times New Roman">
		<li>
<Font face="Times New Roman,serif">
		Consider the environment and take a picture where you look like you are 
a part of it</font></li>

<p>Y<Font face="Times New Roman"><Font face="Times New Roman,serif">our giant 
needs to look natural in your background. Consider the following images...</font></p>

The original photo is of a wreck in New York taken out of a the window of a 
building, so adding in the cat playing with a car fits nicely</p>

She is bouncing a basketball.....on a basketball court.....so.....yeah.....but 
also notice that they guys on the court are looking up at her (they are actually 
looking at the ball bouncing around on the rim, but she is covering that up)</p>
</font>
<p>Notice how the giant in each of the above images fits with what is going on 
around them. This is what you want to shoot for.</p>

Be careful when making your selection because hair can be an issue. Look at 
following images...</p>

Notice that in both images the hair (and fur) has a very sharp edge and does not 
look realistic. Remember that we didn't really have this issue when we selected 
the guy pushing the car in Step 1 because his hair was cut very close to his 
head (yeah, I did that on purpose). If you have lots of hair that is difficult 
to select, consider retaking your picture with your hair slicked down or pulled 
back, or wearing a hat (refer back to the two ladies in Step 1). Keep in mind 
that it is far easier to just take a new picture then to take a long time to try 
and make complicated hair look right.</p>
