<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; "><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>
Some other ways we could accomplish the same thing would be by adjusting Levels, 
Color Balance, Hue/Saturation, and even the Curves Adjustment. All will give us 
darker legs, but none of them can accomplish the matching of the vividness of 
the colors as easily or quickly as using Contrast.</span></p><hr>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; "><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>
He now has a constant depth of color across his entire body. Yes, his colors are 
more vivid than the city, and we will deal with both that and the fact that his 
color does not match his surroundings. Specifically, we need to adjust the tint of our guy to match 
the overall tint of the city. You should have something similar to the image 
below...</span></p>

<Font face="Times New Roman,serif">
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; ">Notice that while the city is 
composed mostly of soft blue and tan colors, our guy is made up of bold colors that 
have a red tint to them. Even his pants, which are blue, have a definite red tint 
to them. If we leave it like this, our guy will stand out in the picture. 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; ">Consider the following image...</p></font>

<Font face="Times New Roman,serif">
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; " align="left">
Note that while the city in the above image is tinted green and blue, the baby has a distinct red 
tint to her. Having images tinted in this way is actually very common. 
Photographs taken outside tend to be tinted blue due to the sky (images taken in 
direct sunlight tend to be tinted yellow because...well, you get it, right?). 
Photographs of people tend to have a red tint to them because they are usually taken in 
artificial light, and people generally look better tinted red. Notice that the 
baby above looks out of place, and it is painfully obvious that she was added to 
the image.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; " align="left">
Now look at this picture...</p></font>

<Font face="Times New Roman,serif">
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; " align="left">
Note that this time the surrounding area has a soft brown/orange tint while the 
boy has a slight red tint. This image actually does a better job of matching the 
tint, but the vibrant colors of the boy's clothes make it obvious that he was 
added in.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; " align="left">
Now look at this picture...</p></font>

<Font face="Times New Roman,serif">
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; " align="left">
The baby in this image has been adjusted so both the tint and color depth match 
the surrounding city. While we know that the baby was added into the image 
(there are obviously no giant babies), the seamless flow of color across the 
image means that the baby does not stand out, but instead blends into the scene. 
This is what we are shooting for with our images - that our additions seem like 
they belong in the image and do not scream 'I'm fake'.</p>
</font>
<Font face="Times New Roman">
<hr>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; ">
We are going to fix both the tint and color depth issues with our image.
<span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Again, there are several
    ways to fix this, so let's use a method that not only makes changes to our 
image that are easy to adjust, but does so in a way that does not alter our 
original image. Let's work with Adjustment Layers. Adjustment layers are exactly 
what the name implies - layers that make adjustments. The great thing about 
adjustment layers is that they allow us to make visible changes to our image 
without actually making changes to the image itself because the adjustments are placed on a separate 
layer that we are free to modify, turn off, delete, etc. If this is a little 
confusing, keep going and it will all make sense.</span></p></font>

<p>The box on the left, with the Col in 
it, let's us know what kind of adjustments this layer is making - in this case 
Color Balance. The box on the right indicates where on the image the color 
balance adjustments are being applied. White areas mean the adjustment is being 
applied, while black areas means it is not. The entire box being white indicates 
that the adjustment is being applied to the entire image. If this seems a little complicated, so just 
keep working and it will become clear.</p>

That is the area you just drew with the Brush Tool. Remember, the white area of 
the box indicates where the adjustment is being applied in the image, and the 
back area indicates that the adjustment is not being used there. So what the 
above graphic is telling us is that the adjustment is being applied everywhere 
(and since we are only applying it to the layer below, it is actually only being 
applied to the guy), except where his shoe is. Notice that his shoe now looks 
more brown and thus more realistic. Let's do the same thing to his skin to get 
it back to a more realistic color.</p>
